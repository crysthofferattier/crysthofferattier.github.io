        Electronics is the branch of science and technology that deals with the <code>flow of electric current and the
                manipulation of
                electrical energy</code>.
        It forms the foundation of modern technology, enabling everything from basic
        household appliances to
        complex computer systems and communication networks.

    <p class="lead">
        At its core, electronics involves the study of components such as resistors, capacitors, diodes, and
        transistors, which
        are used to control and direct electrical current. These components can be combined into circuits that
        perform various
        functions, from simple tasks like lighting a bulb to sophisticated operations in smartphones and medical
        devices.

    <h2>Understanding Electrical Circuits</h2>
    <p class="lead">Electrical circuits are the backbone of many electronic and electrical systems, including PLCs. To
        get started
        with
        ladder logic programming and control systems, it’s essential to understand the basics of electrical circuits.
        Here’s
        an overview of key concepts:</p>

    <h3>1. What is an Electrical Circuit?</h3>
    <p class="lead">An electrical circuit is a path through which electrical current flows. It typically consists of a
        power source,
        conductive paths (wires), and electrical components such as resistors, capacitors, and loads (e.g., lamps,
        motors).
    </p>

    <h3>2. Key Components of an Electrical Circuit</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><code>Power Source</code>: Provides the electrical energy to the circuit. Common examples include
            batteries
            and power supplies.</li>
        <li><code>Conductive Path (Wires)</code>: Conductors that allow the flow of electrical current. Usually made
            of
            copper or aluminum.</li>
        <li><code>Load</code>: The device that uses the electrical energy, such as a light bulb, motor, or PLC
            input/output module.</li>
        <li><code>Switch</code>: A device that controls the flow of electricity in a circuit, such as a pushbutton
            or a
            relay.</li>
        <li><code>Resistor</code>: Limits the amount of current that can flow in the circuit. It is an important
            component in controlling the flow of electricity.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>3. Voltage, Current, and Resistance</h3>
    <p class="lead">In electrical circuits, there are three fundamental quantities that govern how the circuit behaves:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><code>Voltage (V)</code>: The electrical potential difference between two points. It’s what "pushes" the
            current through the circuit. Measured in volts (V).</li>
        <li><code>Current (I)</code>: The flow of electric charge in the circuit. It’s measured in amperes (A).
            Current
            is what powers devices like motors and lights.</li>
        <li><code>Resistance (R)</code>: The opposition to the flow of current in the circuit. Measured in ohms (Ω).
            Resistors are used to control the current in the circuit.</li>
    </ul>
