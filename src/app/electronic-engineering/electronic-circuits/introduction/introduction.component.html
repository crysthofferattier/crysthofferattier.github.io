                Electronics is the branch of science and technology that deals with the <code>flow of electric current and the
                manipulation of
                electrical energy</code>.
                It forms the foundation of modern technology, enabling everything from basic
                household appliances to
                complex computer systems and communication networks.

                At its core, electronics involves the study of components such as resistors, capacitors, diodes, and
                transistors, which
                are used to control and direct electrical current. These components can be combined into circuits that
                perform various
                functions, from simple tasks like lighting a bulb to sophisticated operations in smartphones and medical
                devices.

                        Ohmâ€™s Law
                    </a>
                </code>,
                <code>
                    <a href="/electronic-engineering/electronic-circuits/ohms-law">
                        Kirchhoff's Laws
                    </a>
                </code>,
                and the
                behavior of alternating and direct currents. With advancements in technology, electronics has evolved
                into various
                fields, including digital electronics, analog electronics, and embedded systems, leading to innovations
                that shape our
                daily lives.
