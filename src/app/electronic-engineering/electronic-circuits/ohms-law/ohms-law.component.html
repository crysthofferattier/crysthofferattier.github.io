    <hr>
    <p class="lead">
        Ohm's law states that the electric current through a conductor between two points is directly
        proportional to the
        voltage across the two points. Introducing the constant of proportionality, the resistance,[1] one
        arrives at the three
        mathematical equations used to describe this relationship

            <h2>How Voltage, Current, and Resistance Relate</h2>
            <hr>
            <h3>Voltage</h3>
            <p class="lead">
                The "push" that makes electric charges move; it's like the pressure in a water pipe.
            </p>
            <p class="lead">
                Example: A typical household battery (like AA or AAA) has a voltage of 1.5 volts. This voltage pushes
                the electric
                current through devices like flashlights or remote controls.
            </p>
            <h3>Current</h3>
            <p class="lead">
                The flow of electric charges, similar to the amount of water flowing through a pipe
            </p>
            <p class="lead">
                Example: When you turn on a light bulb, electric current flows through the wires from the power source,
                lighting up the
                bulb. The amount of current can vary; for instance, a standard LED bulb uses about 0.1 amps of current.
            </p>

            <h3>Resistance</h3>
            <p class="lead">
                The opposition to the flow of electric current; like a narrow part of a pipe that slows down
                the water
                flow.
            </p>
            <p class="lead">
                Example: A light bulb has resistance, which limits how much current can flow through it. If you replace
                a regular bulb
                with a higher-resistance bulb (like a LED), it will use less current, resulting in lower energy
                consumption while still
                providing light.

    <h2>Formula</h2>
    <p class="lead">
        <code><strong>V = I × R</strong> </code>
    </p>

    <h2>Explanation</h2>
    <ul class="lead">
        <li><code><strong>Voltage (V)</strong>:</code> The push that moves electric charges.</li>
        <li><code><strong>Current (I)</strong>:</code> The flow of those charges.</li>
        <li><code><strong>Resistance (R)</strong>:</code> How much the flow is opposed.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Examples</h3>

    <h4><code>Finding Current</code></h4>
    <p class="lead"><strong>Scenario</strong>: You have a circuit with a voltage of 12 volts and a resistance of
        4 ohms.</p>
    <p class="lead"><strong>Calculation</strong>: Using Ohm's Law:</p>
    <p class="lead">
        I = V / R = 12 volts / 4 ohms = 3 amps
    </p>
    <p class="lead"><strong>Interpretation</strong>: The current flowing through the circuit is 3 amps.</p>

    <h4><code>Finding Voltage</code></h4>
    <p class="lead"><strong>Scenario</strong>: You have a device that draws 2 amps of current with a resistance
        of 6 ohms.
    </p>
    <p class="lead"><strong>Calculation</strong>: V = I × R = 2 amps × 6 ohms = 12 volts</p>
    <p class="lead"><strong>Interpretation</strong>: The voltage needed to maintain that current is 12 volts.
    </p>

    <h4><code>Finding Resistance</code></h4>
    <p class="lead"><strong>Scenario</strong>: A circuit has a voltage of 24 volts and a current of 8 amps.</p>
    <p class="lead"><strong>Calculation</strong>: R = V / I = 24 volts / 8 amps = 3 ohms</p>
    <p class="lead"><strong>Interpretation</strong>: The resistance in the circuit is 3 ohms.</p>
